Hello there, I'm Ian. I consider myself an evolutionary biologist despite residing in the Institute for Protein Design surrounded by people that circumvent billions of years of evolution to create new proteins. Instead I prefer to look into the past to gain insights into the present. I use protein sequences to predict structure based on evolutionary information and in turn, use structure to gain functional insights into organisms.
